# Contributiton Guide

You shouldn't edit the node class files (all files under `diagram` directory) by yourself.

## Resources

### Update nodes

All node classes was auto-generated from image resource files. For example, the `diagram.aws.compute.EC2` class was auto-generated based on `resources/aws/compute/ec2.png` image resource file.

So, if you want to add new node resources or update existing node resources, you can just add or update the image files in `resources/<provider>/<type>/<image>`.

Then just run the `./autogen.sh` to generate the added or updated node classes.

> IMPORTANT NOTE: To run `autogen.sh`, you need [round](https://github.com/mingrammer/round) and [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/ko/release) command lines that are used for clearning the image resource filenames.

> macOS users can download the inkscape via Homebrew.

### Update Aliases

Some node classes have alias. For example, `aws.compute.ECS` class is an alias of `aws.compute.ElasticContainerService` class. Aliases also were auto-generated from `ALIASES` map in [config.py](config.py).

So, if you want to add new aliases or update existing aliases, you can just add or update the `ALIASES` map in [config.py](config.py).

Then just run the `./autogen.sh` to generate the added or updated aliases.

> IMPORTANT NOTE: To run `autogen.sh`, you need [round](https://github.com/mingrammer/round) and [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/ko/release) command lines that are used for clearning the image resource filenames.
